        <dt>Dancing</dt>
        <dd>I like to cutting shapes shuffle. It is a type of dance that goes along perfectly to my favorite type of
        music,EDM. You may not have heard of it before but to explain shortly...it is the dance that you most likely have seen in the song <q>Party Rock</q> by LMFAO.

        <dd>It's hard for me to conclude who my favorite music Artist is because I listen to a wide range of genres.
        Sometimes on my free time, I just pair my earbuds to my phone, and get lost in the music, until it is time to get back to work.

        <dd>I can't miss out the obvious of course. To be quite honest, it is a good feeling to be able to show off what
        I have created using code, either in C++ or HTML. Sometimes I even surprise myself with my own creatives ideas that I've executed.

        <dt>Gaming</dt>
        <dd>Collectively, I own a variety of games on different platforms: PC, PS3 and Mobile. Despite this, at the start of 2020, I have made a goal to focus on my aspirations and school work. Sadly, this means that I will have to sacrifice playing games.
